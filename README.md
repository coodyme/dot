# Dot

Tired of setting up your development environment every time you start a new project or format your computer? 

`Dot` is a simple tool that allows you to automate the process of setting up your development environment. ðŸš€

There are two types of setups you can use:

`Headless`: Run the setup in a remote server or a virtual machine, and connect via **ssh** from your main PC. (Compatible with `Debian-based` systems).

> The main advantage of this setup is that you can run your development environment in a powerful server, and connect from your main PC, which can be a low-end machine without bloating it with development tools and packages.

> Require a fresh install of `Debian-based` systems like `Ubuntu Server 24.04+`.

`GUI`: Run the setup in your main PC, and use the graphical interface to interact with your development environment.

> The main advantage of this setup is that you can use a single machine for development and personal use, without the need to connect to a remote server. 

> Require a fresh install of `Ubuntu 24.04+`.
