# Dot

Tired of setting up your development environment every time you start a new project or format your computer? 

Dot is a simple tool that allows you to automate the process of setting up your development environment. ðŸš€

You need to have a main PC with your desired OS (macOS, Ubuntu, or Windows) to run the main tools like VSCode, JetBrains DataGrip, Browsers, etc.

Additionally, you will need a VM, or Container to run the development environment. This environment will run on Ubuntu Server without a GUI, dedicated solely for development purposes.  

The main ideia is to have a development environment that is easy to setup, easy to maintain, and easy to share with your team. You just need to run a single command to get your environment up, then just connect via **ssh** from your main PC.

This project is heavily inspired by [omakub](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub).
